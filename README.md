# BondLattice

OUTPUT AND INTPUT:

  In this sage program, we have functions that can:
    - Generate all the set partitions of the bond lattice of a graph
    - Generate all the parking functions from the bond lattice
    - Plot the Hasse diagram of the bond lattice

  Input to the program is:
    - N: the number of vertices of the input graph
    - adjacency list: a dictionary that describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph
  Make changes to these variables in the program to work for your specific graphs.
