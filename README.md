# BondLattice

OUTPUT AND INTPUT:

  In this sage program, we have functions that can:\n
    - Generate all the set partitions of the bond lattice of a graph\n
    - Generate all the parking functions from the bond lattice\n
    - Plot the Hasse diagram of the bond lattice\n

  Input to the program is:\n
    - N: the number of vertices of the input graph\n
    - adjacency list: a dictionary that describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph\n
  Make changes to these variables in the program to work for your specific graphs.\n
